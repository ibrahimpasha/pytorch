    "\n",
    "Imagine teaching a dog to fetch. You don't show it thousands of labeled examples of \"correct fetching\" (that would be supervised learning). Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dog **tries something** (runs toward the ball)\n",
    "2. You give **feedback** (\"Good boy!\" + treat, or nothing)\n",
    "3. The dog **learns** which actions lead to treats\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: learning through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties.\n",

    "| Approach | What it needs | How it learns | Example |\n",

    "| **Unsupervised Learning** | Unlabeled data | Finds patterns/structure | Customer segmentation: group similar buyers |\n",
    "| **Reinforcement Learning** | Environment + rewards | Trial and error | Game AI: +1 for winning, -1 for losing |\n",

    "- This makes learning slow and unstable\n",

    "\n",
    "**Actor-Critic Architecture:**\n",
    "- **Actor**: Policy network π(a|s) - decides what to do\n",
