    "### What is a Tensor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tensor** is a multi-dimensional array—the fundamental data structure in PyTorch and the building block of all deep learning. If you're familiar with NumPy arrays, tensors are conceptually identical, but with two game-changing advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GPU Acceleration**: Tensors can live on GPUs, enabling massively parallel computation. A single GPU can perform thousands of operations simultaneously, making training feasible for models with billions of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic Differentiation**: PyTorch tracks every operation performed on tensors and can automatically compute gradients. This is the magic that makes backpropagation work without manual calculus.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Tensors\n",
    "- Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that support GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation\n",
    "- The key shape in transformers is `(batch, sequence, d_model)` or `(B, S, D)`\n",
    "- Master tensor operations: matrix multiplication (`@`), element-wise ops, broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autograd\n",
    "- PyTorch builds a computational graph during forward pass\n",
    "- `.backward()` computes gradients via chain rule automatically\n",
    "- Always call `optimizer.zero_grad()` before `.backward()` to clear accumulated gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "### nn.Module\n",
    "- All neural network components inherit from `nn.Module`\n",
    "- Use `nn.Parameter` for learnable weights (automatically tracked)\n",
    "- Implement `__init__` for setup and `forward` for computation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "- ReLU: Simple, fast, but can \"die\" (stuck at 0)\n",
    "- GELU: Smooth, used in BERT/GPT, allows small negative values\n",
    "- SiLU/Swish: Self-gated, used in modern LLMs like LLaMA\n",
    "- Softmax: Converts logits to probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Functions\n",
    "- Cross-entropy: Standard for classification and language modeling\n",
    "- Measures how well predicted distribution matches true distribution\n",
    "- Lower loss = higher confidence in correct answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizers\n",
    "- SGD: Simple gradient descent, foundation of all optimizers\n",
    "- Adam: Adaptive learning rates + momentum, standard for transformers\n",
    "- AdamW: Adam with proper weight decay, used in most LLM training\n",

    "\n",
    "An **embedding** is a learned mapping from discrete tokens to continuous vectors. Each token ID becomes a dense vector of real numbers that captures semantic meaning.\n",

    "- $D$ = embedding dimension (d_model)\n",
    "- $x$ = token ID (integer index)\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3.1 The Attention Mechanism: Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Problem Does Attention Solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attention, sequence models (RNNs, LSTMs) had a fundamental limitation: information had to flow sequentially through the network. To connect the first and last words of a long sentence, information had to pass through every intermediate step, leading to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanishing gradients**: Hard to learn long-range dependencies\n",
    "2. **Sequential bottleneck**: Can't parallelize computation\n",
    "3. **Fixed context**: Each position has the same \"view\" of context\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Attention Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention allows **direct connections** between any two positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired\"\n",
    "                                    ↑\n",
    "                                   \"it\" attends directly to \"cat\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing information step-by-step, attention computes a weighted sum of all positions, where weights indicate relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query, Key, Value: The Database Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of attention like a database query:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Database | Attention |\n",
    "|---------|----------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Query (Q)** | What you're searching for | Current token asking \"what should I attend to?\" |\n",
    "| **Key (K)** | Index/tags of stored items | Each token's \"identifier\" for matching |\n",
    "| **Value (V)** | Actual stored content | Information to retrieve if matched |\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention process:\n",
    "1. Compare Query with all Keys (compute similarity scores)\n",
    "2. Convert scores to weights (softmax)\n",
    "3. Weighted sum of Values\n",
    "\n",
